time of the visit and the written report left by the officer, we produced an action plan and sent daily updates with the physical improvemnts that were pointed out. The majortity of the improvements were made with 48 hours and the rest wiithin 1 week of the visit . While I understand that the score given reflected what the offcier observed on the day, I am happy that within one week the action plan was completed and the improvements and tweaks required were made.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n\t&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n\t&lt;div&gt;\n\t\tWith regards to the ice machine. It had been sited in that postion, as when it was delivered it was too big for the door frames. The supplier was going to replace the hopper so it would fit but that hadn&amp;#39;t happened so it had stayed were it was. The ice machine is now sited in its own food preparation grade outbuilding. We closed the kitchen for 24 hours and we redecorated the kitchen ceiling and doors, we also undertook additional deep cleaning, We have replaced an extarctor canopy filter that was missing,We have had an engineer out to look at the refrigerated unit that wasn&amp;rsquo;t maintaining temperature and serviced it. The General Manager and Head Chef have added some additional processes to the Food Safety Management System and we have added items to the cleaning checklist. We have also added signage about keeping windows closed, the kitchen team have been retrained in the cleaning schedule, and shift runners have been retrained in the importance checking the checklist. We look forward with confidence to our revisit&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n","LocalAuthorityCode":"162","LocalAuthorityName":"Three
